subtitle: My role as a mentor helping aspiring full-stack developers.

As my recent mentoring role came to a close today, I find myself reflecting on the journey. For the past seven months, I’ve been on a journey as a Node.js and React mentor, helping students overcome obstacles on their path to becoming full-stack developers. It was amazing and rewarding experience!

At the beginning, I faced a lot of stress, but over time, I grew more comfortable and discovered the joy of teaching others. Many times I was reminded of how much there is to learn. Often, I believed I had the right answers, only to find myself revisiting the basics, rethinking my approach, and articulating my solutions more effectively.

This role taught me the value of continuous learning and the joy of sharing knowledge. There’s something profoundly rewarding in witnessing the moment when someone grasps a challenging concept and moves forward with confidence. Though I’m saddened by the abrupt end of this chapter, I am grateful for this opportunity. Without it, I wouldn’t have discovered how much I truly enjoy this work.

I look forward to continuing this journey of learning and teaching. To all,  thank you for the insightful exchanges and for inspiring me every day. Here’s to more learning, more challenges, and new beginnings!
