title: Here’s to more learning, more challenges, and new beginnings
subtitle: Seven months of learning, teaching — insights from my role as a mentor helping aspiring full-stack developers.
---
As my recent mentoring role came to a close today, I find myself reflecting on the journey. For the past seven months, I’ve been on a journey with GoIT as a Node.js mentor, helping students overcome obstacles on their path to becoming full-stack developers. How amazing and rewarding this experience has been!

At the beginning, I faced a lot of stress, but over time, I grew more comfortable and discovered the joy of teaching others. Each session reminded me of how much there is to learn. Often, I believed I had the right answers, only to find myself revisiting the basics, rethinking my approach, and striving to articulate solutions more effectively.

Even though our interactions were virtual, I felt a strong connection with the people I was helping. Despite the relatively short time we worked together, we shared a journey toward becoming full-stack developers, creating a bond that was both impactful and lasting.

This role taught me the value of continuous learning and the joy of sharing knowledge. There’s something profoundly rewarding in witnessing the moment when someone grasps a challenging concept and moves forward with confidence. Though I’m saddened by the abrupt end of this chapter, I am grateful to GoIT for this opportunity. Without it, I wouldn’t have discovered how much I truly enjoy this work.

I look forward to continuing this journey of learning and teaching. To all my peers and students, thank you for the insightful exchanges and for inspiring me every day. Here’s to more learning, more challenges, and new beginnings!
