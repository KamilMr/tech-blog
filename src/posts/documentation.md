Today, I found out that I enjoy finding information in documentation rather than using Google search approach. I also use Stack Overflow, but the posts I read there often forward me to documentation websites. 

I am getting tired of reading short articles, like "Deep dive into xxx," only to find out that these deep dives provide just a hint. There is so much rubbish out there now. I feel like documentation gives me a solid ground I can put my foot on.

I will update this place and will share website I enjoy the most soon :)
