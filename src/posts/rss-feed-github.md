I continuously work on improving my public presence. This is not an easy task. First, English is my second language. Second, my previous approach was to hide and not show the skills I have. I thought I might get lucky and land a better job if needed. That could be true, but it's also possible that no one will notice me. So yes, I work on it. I read in English, write in English, take all my notes in Obsidian in English, and I publish in English too.

This week, I added an RSS feed to my website and connected it with my GitHub account. Now, when someone visits my main page, they will see the last few notes I wrote on my website.

Creating the logic in `Next.js` was very easy; see this [PR](https://github.com/KamilMr/tech-blog/pull/1). I used the [rss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rss) package, and on GitHub, I used this [repo](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow).
