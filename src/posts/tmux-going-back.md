I had been thinking for some time about going back to the [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) default settings. Recently, I had to connect to a VPS that wasn't mine. They were using tmux, but I struggled because they use the default tmux settings. The problem was that I didn't remember the default keys. So today is the time to change.

I decided to keep only a few plugins that support me well in my workflow and learn tmux a little bit more. Here is my basic [config](https://github.com/KamilMr/LAB/blob/master/conf/.tmux.conf) now.
