title: Resources about learning in public
---
In the last month, I encountered the idea of public learning. I first came across this concept in my school community. Now, I've read a free chapter from [here](https://learninpublic.org/?from=GH%20READMEhttps://learninpublic.org/toc) and [here](https://learninpublic.org/v1-principles-learn-in-public.pdf). I quite enjoyed reading it.

Swyx created a nice list of articles about writing in public as well: https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public
