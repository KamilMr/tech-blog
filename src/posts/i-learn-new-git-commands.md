##  git status --porcelain
This command offers a concise, machine-readable representation of the Git repositoryâ€™s status, which is suitable for scripting. I had to learn this because I needed to develop logic that required me to know the number of files currently being edited. If the output is empty, it indicated that no files had been edited.
