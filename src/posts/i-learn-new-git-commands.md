##  git status --porcelain
This command offers a concise, machine-readable representation of the Git repositoryâ€™s status, which is suitable for scripting. I had to learn this because I needed to develop logic that required me to know the number of files currently being edited. If the output is empty, it indicated that no files had been edited.

## git rev-parse name-of-branch
This is as I understand is a basic command that is used for script manipulation. Some tools are created based on this. Basically it gives SHA1 of the revision. Revision is name of the branch.

We can pass different options to get different results.  More on this in docs [post](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-parse)
