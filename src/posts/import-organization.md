**The Importance of Structuring Imports**

For many developers, particularly those new to large JavaScript projects, the importance of properly structuring imports may not be immediately apparent. However, as projects grow in complexity, a well-organized import structure becomes invaluable for maintaining readability and manageability. Here's a suggested method to structure imports logically and efficiently:

**Suggested Import Structure**

1. **Core Node.js Modules**: Start by importing core Node.js modules (if any). These are modules that come with Node.js, like `fs`, `path`, and `http`.

2. **NPM Packages**: Next, import third-party libraries installed via NPM, such as `express`, `lodash`, or any other external libraries. This helps distinguish built-in modules from those installed from outside sources.

3. **Project-Specific Modules**: Finally, import your own modules, components, or configurations. These are the files and modules that are specific to your project.

4. **Ordering and Casing**: Within each group, you might choose to order imports alphabetically to make them easier to scan. Also, maintaining a consistent casing and ordering strategy (e.g., constants in CAPITAL LETTERS first, followed by camelCase names) can enhance the clarity.

**Example of Structured Imports**:

```javascript
// Core Node.js Modules
import fs from 'fs-extra';
import https from 'https';
import path from 'path';

// NPM Packages
import _ from 'lodash';
import config from 'dotenv';
import express from 'express';

// Project-Specific Modules
import SOME_CONST from './config.js';
import adminRoute from './srv/routes/admin.js';
import calendarRoute from './srv/routes/calendar.js';
import { devRouter } from './srv/routes/dev.js';
```

**Why This Matters**

Organizing imports does not just affect readability and maintainability, it can also impact the ease of debugging and refactoring. When imports are well-organized, developers can quickly locate and update dependencies or troubleshoot issues related to module loading. In team environments, a consistent import structure across all files reduces cognitive load and streamlines code reviews.
