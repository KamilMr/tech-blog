**Short reflection**

It seems to me that I am on the right track to meet my goals. However, I might not finish everything by the end of the upcoming week. My main goal was to rewrite the app to support multiple users, which required creating additional modules, such as a signup flow. I also wanted to enable expense sharing with my family, which led to the need for a housing concept to support this functionality. Redesigning the database and creating new views took longer than I anticipated.

Although my initial deadline was set for mid-December, I had hoped in my mind to complete everything by the end of this month.
### 2024-11-23
- Today, I successfully completed rewriting the income backend API to use Knex.js. During this process, I made some unrelated changes to the codebase to improve its overall structure.
- I also began making changes to the fronted. Since the schema for incoming payloads has changed, I prioritized updating types first. I am deliberately taking a careful approach to types accuracy.  Hopefully this will lead to more robust outcome. 

### 2024-11-22
- Today, I rewrote the categories API, `get` and `post` income API. 

### 2024-11-20
- Continued rewriting database queries using `Knex.js`, focusing on retrieving all categories.
- It seems to me, I am on right track to meet my goals for this month. At the moment I am focusing on rewriting all my queries using `Knex.js`. Once that is complete, I will begin implementing sign up module. However, I need to stay disciplined to meet my weekly hour targets.

### 2024-11-18 
- Designed two views using Excalidraw. The first view is for adding a new home and new users, while the second is for listing and adding new categories.

### 2024-11-16
  - I read about expo routing, how it works. Mostly refreshing mu knowledge. 
  
### 2024-11-14
- Reorganized the expense flow to align with the new housing module structure.
