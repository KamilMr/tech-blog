title: Labels in Obsidian Turning Black on Ubuntu 22

On Ubuntu 22 (not sure about other systems), every few months I need to run the script below to fix an issue with labels turning black in Obsidian's graph view. The problem likely arises due to a cache issue.

```bash
 rm -rf ~/.config/obsidian/GPUCache/
```

I havenâ€™t looked into the details of why this happens. For more information, see the link below:
