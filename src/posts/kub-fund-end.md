Today, I finished studying the Kubernetes Masterclass for Beginners. It was a hands-on lab with a bit of theory and very practical. I was able to create a cluster on my own PC where I am currently running a few applications, with stable storage exposed in my local network. It was an enjoyable quest, and now I am ready to practice this much more to get the knowledge into my fingers.

So yes, after reviewing what I have learned, the next stage is running my own home lab.
