title: Installing k3s and k9s on my laptop

Today, as part of my review, I decided to install a new cluster on my laptop. Whenever I travel, I take it with me, so I thought it would be nice to practice when I am away from my PC.

I must admit that I was wrong when I was watching the tutorial and thinking that it was easy. Doing it only from memory was almost impossible. I did not remember what should be installed next. Thanks to the notes I took in my Obsidian vault, it was much, much easier.

So, yeah, I have `k3s` running a cluster on my laptop with `k9s` installed as well. The next step is to run some apps.
