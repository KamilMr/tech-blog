**Common Misunderstanding Among New Node.js Developers**

Many new developers working with Node.js and Express do not realize that response methods such as `res.send()` and `res.json()` do not stop the execution of code within a function. This misunderstanding can lead to issues such as sending multiple responses to a single request, which can cause errors.

Here is an example illustrating this issue:

```javascript
router.post('api/users', async (req, res) => {
	const isvalid = validation.validate(req.body);
	if (isvalid === false) res.send('some error message'); // this does not stop execution
	await savetodatabase(req.body); // this will run
	res.send('ok') // this will also run and can cause an error
});
```

In the example above, even if the validation fails and the error message is sent, the function continues to execute. This leads to an attempt to execute `savetodatabase(req.body)` and subsequently send another response `res.send('ok')`, which can throw an error because HTTP headers cannot be set after they are sent.

**Solution: Use Return with Response Methods**

To properly manage the control flow and avoid these issues, you should use the `return` statement with the response method when you want to terminate the function execution immediately after sending a response:

```javascript
router.post('api/users', async (req, res) => {
	const isvalid = validation.validate(req.body);
	if (isvalid === false) return res.send('some error message'); 
	await savetodatabase(req.body); // this will not run if isValid === false
	res.send('ok') // this will not run if isValid === false
});
```

By incorporating `return` with `res.send('some error message')`, the function execution stops if the validation fails, thus preventing any further code from running and ensuring that no additional responses are attempted.
