# Where to Find Reliable Resources About Node.js

Here are some websites that will help you continue your journey with Node.js:

1. **[Node.js API Documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/)**  
   This is the main resource. Without it, you won't get far. Becoming familiar with the documentation is one of the key skills required to become a programmer.

2. **[Basic Introduction](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs)**  
   New to Node.js? This is a well-written basic introduction to Node.js. I enjoy reading this type of documentation, and sometimes, before going to bed, I'll spend a few minutes with these docs. This one is a favorite of mine.

3. **[Hey Node](https://heynode.com/)**  
   I discovered this a few months ago. They tackle various topics related to Node.js, and they helped me deepen my understanding of the event loop in Node.js.

4. **[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_get_started.asp)**  
   This is probably the simplest resource on the list. While I didn't find it very helpful for deep understanding, it provides an overview of some topics and includes basic code snippets. I included it here because this website is quite well-known.

This resource will be updated whenever I come across something meaningful.
