I just started my tech blog. Today is the day it came to life.  

It is a small project at the moment and a simple one because when something is born it is also small and simple. Its purpose is to be a process not a ready made product. I am doing this to log my tech journey, share with others what I have just learned during the day or probably the past few days. Hopefully some will find it useful in some way. 

To build it up, I had to get accustomed with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).  I am surprised at how easy it was to use it once you are familiar with `react` and `nodejs`. I use [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/) to host the page and [github](https://github.com/) and its actions to continuously update posts with ease. I write them using markdown language and then I use [Markdown to jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-jsx) to translate markdowns articles to `jsx` and then by using [@tailwindcss/typography](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tailwindcss/typography) I make it look more nicer.
