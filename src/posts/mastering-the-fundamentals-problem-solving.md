Today I have been pondering what means "_mastering the fundamentals of problem solving_". I come up with few steps:

1. **Practice small problems daily** – e.g. use [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com), or [Edabit](https://edabit.com).
2. **Always write down what the problem is asking.**
3. **Break the solution into steps before coding.**
4. **Use plain language first**, then write code.
5. **Review others’ solutions to learn new tricks.**
6. **Try to explain your solution to someone (or rubber duck).**
