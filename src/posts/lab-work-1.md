Saturday morning, playing with serversâ€”just doing some basic experimentation.

In this commit, I tested how `setTimeout` behaves when an error occurs during file reading. Most of the time, it runs after the poll and check phasesâ€”in the next cycle of the event loop.

In my lab, I added raw serversâ€”one for HTTP and another for HTTPS. I also included corresponding clients for both protocols.

For the HTTPS server, I needed to generate a self-signed certificate. Here's the commit and the OpenSSL commands I used:

```bash
# Create a private key
openssl genrsa -out private-key.pem 2048

# Create a certificate and self-sign it with the private key
openssl req -new -x509 -key private-key.pem -out certificate.pem -days 365
