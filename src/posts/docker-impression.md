I just finished the course **Docker for the Absolute Beginners**, and I really enjoyed it. The Mumshad combines clear lectures with hands-on labs, integrated through kodekloud.com, which gave me the ability to start using Docker in my homelab.

I particularly enjoyed the sections on networking and managing persistent storage. I’m even thinking about dockerizing everything now :-)

At the beginning, the course  seamed to me that it was a bit short. However, when combined with the KodeKloud labs, it turned out to be much more substantial. The labs aren’t too challenging—I think their main purpose is to help put the concepts into practice.

Overall, I highly recommend it.

In case someone whats to know what course I am referring to:
