So far, I have been doing many things simultaneously, which is also evident in my tech notes. :-) This approach does not help me delve deeply into a subject for an extended period and fully "taste" it. I am going to change that approach by dedicating my spare time to three subjects.

This month, I am going to deepen my knowledge of Node.js, and most of my notes will be related to this subject. This decision is based on the fact that I am a Node.js developer, and I would like my core skills to be related to this field at this time in my life.

In the meantime, I will tinker with my homelab, trying not to forget what I have learned during the Kubernetes beginner course. I also bought a Docker course on Udemy; if I have spare time, I may start this as well.
