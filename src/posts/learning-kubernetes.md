In the last few days, in my free time after my daily work, I take a short break and start learning Kubernetes. For that, I study a course available on Udemy: [Kubernetes Masterclass for Beginners by Mischa van den Burg](https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-masterclass-for-beginners/?couponCode=ST21MT61124). The goal is to start my home lab where I will be able to run my cluster.

**Stages:**
- Watch one video every day and take notes. I decided to slowly digest new knowledge and understand concepts at a basic level first. It should take approximately 16 hours total, with a maximum of 20 hours.
- Play with it a bit on my computer.
- Run my first home lab cluster. I have an old BenQ laptop that will be perfect for this. I may also use the Raspberry Pi 2 that has not been used for a while.
