title: Who I am?
---

I am a full stack developer and tech lead with a rich past that shaped how I build software and work with people.

### What I Do Now

I lead a small team of 4. I break down features into tasks, assign work, and make strategic technology decisions. On the technical side, I design databases, define API contracts, and implement features from backend to frontend.

I work with React, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. I manage containerized backends on AWS and build CI/CD pipelines from commit to deployment.

After work, I build my own React Native apps with Expo. I ship them with a complete pipeline - from GitHub push to Firebase distribution to real users.

### The Path Here

I wrote my first program - a calculator in Turbo Pascal - when I was 14. But a few years later my path strayed to different worlds.

I studied philosophy and theology, then spent a decade in a monastic order. There I learned tools I still use today: structured reflection, deep listening, and a framework for making decisions. While there, I became a psychotherapist and spent years helping people understand themselves.

In 2020 I returned to what I call the forgotten shores - the IT world. I started with a bootcamp and fell in love again. That love is still there, kindling at the bottom of my heart. Since then, I grew from junior to leading a team.

### What I Believe

**Serve people.** Everything we build should serve someone. Whenever I create, I think about how someone will use it. The technology should serve. The app should serve. Even the shortest line of code should follow this approach.

**Decide, do, reflect, repeat.** I am not perfect. The code I write today can be written better tomorrow. Knowing this keeps me humble and always improving.

**Listen first.** Understanding comes before solutions. This applies to users, teammates, and problems in code.

**Trust in people.** Everyone wants to do good work. Being a monk and a therapist taught me to believe in people. This shapes how I speak and collaborate. I find that trust brings out the best in teams.

### What You'll Find Here

This website is a small corner I own in the ocean of bytes. A mixture of short tips and longer articles about what I love and what I struggle with.

I write in English though Polish is my first language. Welcome, and I am glad you are here.
